Basic voice recognition program that uses vosk-API as recognition tool and pyperclip for easy copypasting

tested on rus and eng, was better for me then other opensource options like sphinx or deepspech

to use it you need https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models for your language and paste extracted folder name to line 99 in main (self.recognizer = Recognizer("folder name goes here"))
